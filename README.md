This repository contains a comprehensive News Management System built using Firebase, designed to streamline the management and viewing of news updates. The system consists of two applications: a User App and an Admin App. The User App provides a seamless interface for users to browse and view the latest news updates, displaying titles, descriptions, and images fetched securely from Firebase Firestore. The Admin App allows administrators to log in securely using Firebase Authentication and add news items by providing a title, description, and an uploaded image, which is stored in Firebase Storage. The project utilizes Firebase services such as Authentication for role-based access control, Firestore for database management (preferred over Realtime Database due to its better querying capabilities, scalability, and structured data handling), and Storage for handling media files. Both apps are structured for easy deployment and integration, making this system a robust solution for news content management.
